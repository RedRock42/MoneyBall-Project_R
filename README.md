# Moneyball Project

This folder contains the necessary files for an indepth Moneyball analysis.

### Background
The Oakland Athletics' 2002 season was the team's 35th in Oakland, California. It was also the 102nd season in franchise history. The Athletics finished first in the American League West with a record of 103-59.
#Because of the team's smaller revenues, Oakland is forced to find players undervalued by the market, and their system for finding value in undervalued players has proven itself thus far. This approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.


Goal for this project:
The primary goal of this project is to use 2016 baseball statistics from Sean Lahaman's Website (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) to find replacement players for the Toronto BlueJays. The Toronto Blue Jays are in the American League East division along with NY Yankees and Boston Red Soxs, needless to say I have my work cut out for me!
